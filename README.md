# Verification Condition Generator

PyVCG is a utility library to generate VCs directly for
[CVC5](https://cvc5.github.io) or standard-compliant
[SMTLIB2](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/). The interface is deliberately
generic and it should be easy to add API support for other solvers in
the future.

This is pretty limited for now as the initial target is the expression
language of [TRLC](https://github.com/bmw-software-engineering/trlc).
